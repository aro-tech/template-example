# Examples of custom AssertJ mixins including generated assertions

Requires Java 8


##What you can learn here

[EmployeeTest.java] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/blob/master/src/test/java/org/example/test/EmployeeTest.java) is an example of a test class using test fixture mixins, including custom-generated AssertJ assertions.

With the maven command `mvn assertj:generate-assertions` you can generate custom assertions for the example JavaBeans. That's how classes here like [EmployeeAssert] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/blob/master/src/test/java/org/example/EmployeeAssert.java) were generated automatically.

In the src/test/resources directory there are custom templates for the generation of these assertions which allow extra fluidity. 

Note that the generated standard endpoint [Assertions.java] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/blob/master/src/test/java/org/example/assertions/generated/Assertions.java) is not a class but a mixin interface.  The advantage of this is that no static imports are necessary, and you can build up test fixture capabilities by subtyping/subclassing. The generated standard endpoint `Assertions.java` is an example of a test fixture built up by subtyping/subclassing using mixins - it extends AllAssertions from my [tdd-mixins-junit4 project] (https://github.com/aro-tech/tdd-mixins-junit4).

Unfortunately, for now ([known issue] (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/65)), the AssertJ assertions generator does not allow renaming of the standard endpoint class, which is why EmployeeTest is defined using `implements org.example.assertions.generated.Assertions` instead of something like `implements CustomAssertionsMixin`. There are other classes named "Assertions", so I felt the need to use the fully qualified name for clarity.

## How the mixin is generated

The *pom.xml* contains the plugin "assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin" and configures it to specify which JavaBeans to target and which template files to override.


The customized template files are in [src/test/resources/templates/] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/tree/master/src/test/resources/templates) 

The template [*my_assertions_entry_point_class_template.txt*] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/tree/master/src/test/resources/templates/my_assertions_entry_point_class_template.txt) defines Assertions not as a class but as an interface (and one which extends mixins for standard AssertJ and JUnit assertions from tdd-mixins-junit4.

The template [*my_assertions_entry_point_method_template.txt*] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/tree/master/src/test/resources/templates/my_assertions_entry_point_method_template.txt) defines each method of Assertions as a default method rather than a public static method.

# Added goodies

The template [*my_has_assertion_template.txt*] (https://github.com/aro-tech/template-example/tree/master/src/test/resources/templates/my_has_assertion_template.txt) defines additional methods which are more useful for the case where a member object of the asserted JavaBean is also a JavaBean.  

I added method templates to generate methods like `hasEmployerMatching` which lets you match with a lambda instead of having to match against an object which is equal to the `Employer`. 

I also added a method to allow switching from the target JavaBean's assertion (e.g. EmployeeAssert) to a StringAssert on the toString() of the member JavaBean.  So we can call `assertThat(employee).hasEmployerAsString().doesNotContain("Initrode")`. 

# Limitations
I would have liked to go farther with this, but the custom assertions generator does not allow conditional processing in the templates.  It would be nice to be able to call something like `assertThat(employee).hasEmployerThat().hasAddressThat().hasPostalCode("11235")`, but I think this is only possible if you manually add methods to the generated asserts.  I tried adding a `has${Property}That()` method in the templates, but in too many cases it generated compiler errors.  There's an [open issue related to this] (https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/67).
